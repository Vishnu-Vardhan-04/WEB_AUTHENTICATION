# WEB AUTHENTICATION

A Node.js web application that lets users anonymously share their secrets. Built with Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js, it demonstrates modern bcrypt authentication techniques including local login and Google OAuth.

# üìö Section Coverage (From Course)

This app was developed as part of **Section 35: Authentication and Security** of a web development course. The section includes:
- Email/password registration with encryption
- Password salting and hashing
- Session and cookie management
- Using environment variables for security
- Google OAuth integration

# üöÄ Features

- Register and login with email and password
- Passwords are encrypted and salted with bcrypt
- Option to login using Google OAuth 2.0
- Secrets submitted anonymously and displayed to all users
- Sessions and cookies handled securely
- Sensitive credentials managed with environment variables

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, EJS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (Local Strategy & Google OAuth 2.0)
- **Encryption**: bcrypt
- **Session Management**: express-session
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv

# üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   i. git clone https://github.com/your-username/secrets-app.git
   ii. cd secrets-app

2. Install dependencies:
  npm install

3. Create a .env file in the root directory:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=our_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_WORD
PG_USER=YOUR_DATABSE
PG_HOST="localhost"
PG_DATABASE=YOUR_DATABSE_NAME
PG_PASSWORD=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD
PG_PORT=DATABAE_PORT

4. Run the server:
  nodemon index.js

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:3000
